# Ethical Hacking Practicals

This repository contains practical lab exercises for **Module 3: Nmap & Scapy** from the Cisco Ethical Hacking course.  
It is designed to document my work, observations, and results from hands-on exercises in network scanning and packet analysis.

## Repository Structure

## Objectives

- Reproduce Nmap labs:
  - Host discovery
  - Port scanning
  - Service enumeration
  - OS detection
  - SMB enumeration
- Reproduce Scapy labs:
  - Packet crafting
  - Packet sniffing
  - Basic protocol analysis
- Document steps, observations, and expected results clearly

## Usage

1. **Nmap Labs**  
   - Navigate to `/nmap-labs`  
   - Read `nmap-commands.txt` for instructions, commands, and expected results  
   - Optional: view screenshots in `/screenshots/`  

2. **Scapy Labs**  
   - Navigate to `/scapy-labs`  
   - Read `scapy-commands.txt` for instructions, commands, and expected results  
   - Optional: view screenshots in `/screenshots/`  

## Notes

- All outputs in the text files are **example outputs** using lab IPs: `10.0.2.2`, `10.0.2.15`, and interface `eth0`.  
- Replace example outputs with actual outputs if running in your environment.  
- Screenshots can be added for clarity but are optional.
